ok,can play manually - nice!

next steps:

be able to play against other agents, not just random
codify "agent" -> takes observations,returns actions

build eval suite
-at first, custom, just score averaged over a few games against other agents...
-eventually mimic the skill score metric used by kaggle

then start to think about training
how to represent action space?
